# CSSI  HTML Student Walkthough

HTML is the foundational technology for the Internet, every one of your favorite websites is HTML at its core. This walkthrough explains how to create an HTML site from scratch, and start creating a personal web page.

#### What is a Webpage?
A basic web page is just a file that can be loaded from your browser, like Chrome, Safari or Internet Explorer.
Most webpages are stored on servers all over the world. To get to those files from our browser we have to use a URL - Uniform Reference Locator. This is an address that tells our browser where to find each file.

However, you can also create a webpage _locally_ (on your own computer) and open it in your browser. This is what we'll start with today. 

#### File Extensions
All programs start out as text files. In order to let other programs (and humans) know what language a file is written in, we add a different file extension. So, the html files are saved as file**.html**, javascript files are saved as file**.js**, CSS files are named file**.css**, and python files are file**.py.**

When we start writing in HTML, what extension will we use? .html of course!
