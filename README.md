# CSSI  HTML Student Walkthough

HTML is the foundational technology for the Internet, every one of your favorite websites is HTML at its core. This walkthrough explains how to create an HTML site from scratch, and start creating a personal web page.

Most webpages are stored on servers all over the world. To get to those files from our browser we have to use a URL - Uniform Reference Locator. This is an address that tells our browser where to find each file.
